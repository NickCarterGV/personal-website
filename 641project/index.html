	<h1>CIS 641 Semester Project Information</h1>
	<p>For our semester project, my partner (Cam Schneider) and I are creating a web-based rougelike baseball videogame. A couple features of our game include the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simple baseball diamond interface with stats and player names listed</li>
        <li>Stat-based, chance gameplay. Players can level up several different stats to increase the odds of specific game functions happening</li>
        <li>Authentication and save states to save your progress and pick up where you left off</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <p>My favorite soccer team is Chelsea FC in the Premier League, I love playing big, open-world single player games, and I'm always game to go to the movie theater for any movie.</p>
